  ## Description:
  This logo generator application will generate a logo based on user input. It will make use of the command line and asks the user for which shape they want their logo to be, the colour of their logo, what text will be on their logo and the colour of the text. Based on the users' input a svg file containing the logo is then generated.
  This application was created using javascript, node.js and the inquirer package.
